# Hey Brother (or sister) ðŸ‘‹
A pleasure to meet you!  I suppose I should introduce myself:
The name's **Daylan Jewell**, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at Andrews University.  As of late, my hobbies include coding (hence the new GitHub page), gaming, Bible study, and doing research to deepen my knowledge in any one of those things.  As such, you can expect my projects will have some mixture of all of these, but I'll confess I do give some supremacy to my Biblical interests.

Here's What I'm Up To
---------------------
I'm just getting started with coding projects, the first of them being the little website I have up here.  I'm just trying to expand my portfolio of experiences while in college.

What I'm Learning and Why
-------------------------
*Obviously*, that comes with learning the necessary skills to do so.  I intend to get into JavaScript and other web-dev languages so I can get a deeper understanding of what that line of work entails.  But I'm also going to dabble in Java to build some Minecraft mods I've been thinking about, along with some C# for Terraria ones, eventually.  As you might be able to tell, I'm a little ambitious, but I hear that's a good thing when you're invested in something.

How to Contact Me, and stuff
----------------------------
Anyhow, if you want to talk to me about a project I'm working on, an idea you might want to collab on, or just strike up some friendly conversation, my email is <daylanproffesional@gmail.com> (Yes, I know professional is spelled wrong; the awful thing about having the foresight to get a professional email at 13 is not knowing how to *spell it* correctly)

May God bless you!
